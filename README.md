# 👋 Howdy, I'm Cleburn

I build AI systems that turn what works into what scales.

Right now, that looks like: Python data pipelines, interactive web apps, and tools that automate the research process for real estate investors. Soon it'll be: LLM-powered systems, RAG architectures, and intelligent automation for businesses.

I'm moving through a 9-month AI Engineer roadmap — learning in public, building portfolio-ready projects, and shipping real solutions every week.

## 🧭 What I'm About

I spent years managing investment properties, leading sales teams, and building businesses. I got good at spotting patterns humans miss and systems humans avoid building. Now I'm learning to code those insights into tools that work at scale.

**Guiding principle:** Intelligence — human or artificial — is meant to serve people.

**Background:** U.S. Marine Corps → Professional Athlete → Real Estate Investor → AI Engineer
