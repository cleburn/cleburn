# üëã Howdy, I'm Cleburn

I build AI systems that turn what works into what scales.

Right now, that looks like: Python data pipelines, interactive web apps, and tools that automate the research process for real estate investors. Soon it'll be: LLM-powered systems, RAG architectures, and intelligent automation for businesses.

I'm moving through a 9-month AI Engineer roadmap ‚Äî learning in public, building portfolio-ready projects, and shipping real solutions every week.
