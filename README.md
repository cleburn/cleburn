# Howdy, I’m Cleburn 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I’m exploring Python, AI/ML, and sharpening my math intuition — learning how these tools can shape the future while keeping the journey creative and enjoyable.

## About Me
- 🚀 Currently building projects in Python and experimenting with data analysis + machine learning.  
- 🧩 I enjoy breaking down complex problems into clear, practical solutions (whether in code or life).  
- ✍️ Writing is where I think best — and I bring that same clarity into programming.  
- 👨‍👧‍👦 Full-time single parent of three amazing kids, balancing family life with a passion for tech and creativity.  
- 🌍 Big-picture goal: build a life of freedom, impact, and curiosity while contributing to projects that help people connect more deeply with each other and the world.
